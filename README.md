# Project TalkTask
## CS362-Winter2025-Team20

## Overview
TalkTask is a personal to-do list tracker website that includes speech recognition for to-do list management. Designed with accesibility and ease of access in mind, TalkTask should provide a hands-free and user-friendly experience across various devices, such as desktops and mobile. Additionally, if given enough time, we will implementing a database to save users information and previous tasks and implement an AI feature that will be able to handle natural language and recommend tasks for the user based on previous tasks.

## Repository Layout
Our repsitory includes configuration files for building the website with React and Vite, a reports directory for weekly updates on the project, and a src directory to contain all of our source code files.

## Major goals for the project will include... 
* Creating a website that correctly parses voice input into to-do list commands
* Implementing a database to store past list items
* Implement AI functionality to provide reccommended tasks given a users history
* Develop a user-friendly UI that not only looks good, but functions properly

## Additional stretch goals will include...
* Adding reminders for timely tasks
* Expanding AI functionality to incorporate natural language into to-do list commands
* Gamifying the UI and website to keep users engaged and on track with completing their tasks
