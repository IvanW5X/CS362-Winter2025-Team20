* Implement add and remove functionality using WebSpeechAPI.


### Ivan Wong

#### Goals

* Switch to the transformers library, replacing the inference library to fine-tune my choice of AI model for our use case.
* Refactor current backend source files to an even higher level of abstraction using the controllers concept.
* Start researching OAuth and how to itegrate it to our project.

#### Progress & Issues

* For our AI functionality, I came across a lot of issues with the AI models provided by Hugging Face. Most of of the models I used either needed to be trained using Python or were not producing logical outputs based on a list of tasks. To resolve this issue, I decided to look into other free AI models and tested various models with different prompts and found Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model produced exactly what we needed for our use case and was fairly simple to setup, since the documentation provided example code.
* For refactoring our backend files, I managed to seperate our logic even further and edited current code to follow the MVC architecture that we mentioned before in both our living doc. Specifically, I moved the code in the services files in the backend to the controller files because it was more fitting and handles the HTTP logic and API end routes. I also refactored the code in our index.js file to be responsible for connecting the database and our server.js file to use the controller routes.
* For OAuth, the AI functionality took up most of time relative to what I allocate for this course, so I wasn't able to research how to implement OAuth into our project.

#### Next Week's Plans & Goals

* Start researching OAuth and and how to integrate it to our project.
* Look into GitHub Actions and begin setting up CI/CD pipelines.

### Tristan Vosburg

#### Goals

* Application Implementation of WebSpeechAPI: Begin the full implementation of WebSpeechAPI with application, with simple functionalties such as add and remove
* Add functionality to tokenize and error handle speech input string

#### Progress & Issues

* I continued improving on Raymond's menu commands and made key words for each step.
* Using Raymond's color picker prototype, I created a proof of concept for menu navigation using WebSpeechAPI.  

#### Next Week's Plans & Goals

* Full Implementation of WebSpeechAPI: Add other functionalities of application that use WebSpeechAPI such as edit, sort, and view.
* Full Implementation of WebSpeechAPI: Aid in development of UI and frontend features to ensure user-friendly experiences and accurate information being displayed.
