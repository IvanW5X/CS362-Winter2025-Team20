# Week 6 Project Report

## Team Report

### Progress & Issues

* Progress for our project is moving steadily. Our frontend developers have added the Navbar component and started implementing the sidebar that holds the tasks lists and the task section itself. Our backend files have been refatored to follow MVC architecture more accurately, packages have been updated, and most of our teammates now have access to the database as an admin. As far as the speech recognition functionality, it can now parse and process commands to the main task management functions like add, remove, and mark tasks. These functions now just need to be linked to the database once we test them and ensure that they are working as intended. Our suggest task functionality is nearly complete and has been switched to using Google's Gemini 2.0 Flah model with the free API plan, so that we can avoid training an AI model and focus on testing and producing a working product. Various TalkTask logos have been created for both complete and simpler versions, so that they have different dimensions and can be placed where we see fit.

### Next Week's Plans & Goals

* The frontends main goal is to start working with the database to be able to store info primarily for tasks as well bringing the overall main pages ui to look as similar to the figma as possible with minor changes as needed.

#### Next Week's Plans & Goals

* Implement add and remove functionality using WebSpeechAPI.


### Ivan Wong

#### Goals

* Switch to the transformers library, replacing the inference library to fine-tune my choice of AI model for our use case.
* Refactor current backend source files to an even higher level of abstraction using the controllers concept.
* Start researching OAuth and how to itegrate it to our project.

#### Progress & Issues

* For our AI functionality, I came across a lot of issues with the AI models provided by Hugging Face. Most of of the models I used either needed to be trained using Python or were not producing logical outputs based on a list of tasks. To resolve this issue, I decided to look into other free AI models and tested various models with different prompts and found Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model produced exactly what we needed for our use case and was fairly simple to setup, since the documentation provided example code.
* For refactoring our backend files, I managed to seperate our logic even further and edited current code to follow the MVC architecture that we mentioned before in both our living doc. Specifically, I moved the code in the services files in the backend to the controller files because it was more fitting and handles the HTTP logic and API end routes. I also refactored the code in our index.js file to be responsible for connecting the database and our server.js file to use the controller routes.
* For OAuth, the AI functionality took up most of time relative to what I allocate for this course, so I wasn't able to research how to implement OAuth into our project.

#### Next Week's Plans & Goals

* Start researching OAuth and and how to integrate it to our project.
* Look into GitHub Actions and begin setting up CI/CD pipelines.

### Jordan Cowan

#### Goals

* My goal for Next week is to have properly completed the add, update, and delete functionality to the tasks buttons.
* I would also like to make it so that the dates in the calendar section above tasks can be cycled through to show multiple dates and not just a static set of dates.

#### Progress & Issues

* I ran into some issues with trying to get added as an admin to the mongodb database causing a delay on working on functionality for the tasks 
* I got the design looking mostly like the figma design minus some sizing differences that will be worked out once every component is able to be put together properly and some styling that will be easier to work on when I can add some functionality.

#### Next Week's Plans & Goals

* My plans for next week are to get the tasks portion working along with looking like a task as shown in the ui/ux designers draft of our app.
* On top of this I will be adding the "If there are particular assumptions underpinning your chosen architecture, identify and describe them." section of the living doc as to be inline with the project architecture and design assignment.
