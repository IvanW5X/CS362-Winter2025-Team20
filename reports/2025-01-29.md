# Week 4 Project Report

## Team Report

### Progress & Issues

* This week was all about project architecture, communication, and actually starting developement of TalkTask. Deliverables include importing the WebSpeech API to the frontend, connecting the database to the backend, importing the AI model to backend, and lots of directory setup. Team meetings have been hosted over zoom to discuss how the frontend components will be divided and the backend directory has been structured according to popular and modular web backend architecture. Many of the files and folders included have been split up modularly to keep everything scalable and seperate of each other, so when the testing phase comes, it shall be completed more easily. The UI sketches are nearly complete and just need some finishing touches, and client/server communication has been established and ready for logic. The trello board has also been updated to reflect the tasks of each team member, so constant communication on whos doing what can be minimized.

### Next Week's Plans & Goals

* 

## Individual Contributions

### Jordan Cowan

#### Goals

* My primary goal is to have gotten an understanding of how the app should be designed and what I need to have learned to get started on that.
* Next I plan to have started work on the project, primarily with designing the main functionality of the site such as a section for the to-do list, to create tasks, delete tasks, and complete tasks.

#### Progress & Issues

*  I have made steady progress with these goals having formed a more complete understanding of what the program should look like, what my section of work will consist of, and how the frontend, backend, and database will come together.
*  I have started work on the project albeit not quite as much as I would like. So far I have gotten a start on the page design to make it look more inline with our ui/ux designers drafts of the app.

#### Next Week's Plans & Goals

* My plans for next week are to get the taks portion working along with looking like a task as show in the ui/ux designers draft of our app.
* On top of this I will be adding the "If there are particular assumptions underpinning your chosen architecture, identify and describe them." section of the living doc as to be inline with the project architecture and design assignment.

### Kai Lindskog-Coffin

#### Goals

* Design, create, and post entity relationship diagram/ schema to repo; This helps  visualize and conceptualize the database.
* Connect MongoDB cluster to codebase
* Create CRUD operations for Users, Tasks, Reminders, Speech Command

#### Progress & Issues

* I stared the week by creating the ER diagram, then converting it into a schema and illustrating it via Mermaid in an md file. This week I managed to completely connect the database to our website, as well as verify that it can connect reliably. Creating and connnecting the database was a challenge, as I accidentally pushed the URI to the public repository. I created a new cluster with different cridentials. After successfully connecting the database, I created schema js files in /backend/db/models, as well as creating routes and service files for the User schema. Communicating the proper login information in a secure way was challenging, however I ultimately verbally conveyed it in a meeting, as to not risk another cridential leak. 
#### Next Week's Plans & Goals

*   Expand CRUD operations, as well as gather more attributes for current and future entities in the database.
*   Research and collaborate further with Ivan on the topic of AI that can create reccomendations.

### Ivan Wong

#### Goals

* Find a suitable backend web server hosting service or tool that is free of charge.
* Coordinate with Bailey (UX/UI Designer) and backend developers to discuss how our project will be implemented, so that I can configure our files according to OO practices.

#### Progress & Issues

* This week I managed to find and test Render, a backend web service hosting platform, to deploy our backend server. I've run it with our frontend client and it works as intended, so I have suspended the service, until we create an MVP. I've also hosted meetings over zoom to discuss our UI design ideas with the team and went over the project directory setup, to explain what changes I've made to the directory. I split the frontend directory to include seperate pages, UI components, and a services folder. I split the backend directory to include a controller, db (database), middleware, routes, services, and an updated index.js file according to standard web development practices, keeping everything modular and ready for development. I also created and added a test file in my own configurations branch to include an AI model from hugging face. I managed to get it working, but I have yet to find a suitable AI model small enough (< 10gb) that works as intended, so more research will be conducted with mini models.

#### Next Week's Plans & Goals

* Find an AI model small enough that is able to generate a relevant, single, suggested task given the context of previous tasks.
* Start researching more backend web developement architecture to create backend files for backend developers to start on.

### Raymond Cen

#### Goals

* Create a list of phrases and words that the correlate with functions created.
* Coordinate with other backend developer on how to divide workload.

#### Progress & Issues

* I came up with a list of potential commands for the website and made a new branch to work on the WebSpeechAPI
* I've implemented an example of an application that uses WebSpeechAPI to get a better understanding of what I need to do. I found out that its more of a frontend thing but it still needs to communicate with the backend to manipulate the tasks. 

#### Next Week's Plans & Goals

* Test voice input and ensure the WebSpeechAPI voice input is working properly.
* Implement WebSpeechAPI with the purpose of also implementing commands into the API.

### Bailey Budlong

#### Goals

* Communicate with front end developers about proposed UI design

#### Progress & Issues

* Had a meeting with other front end developers, and team, to discuss collective vision / steps to take with the UI design. Nearly everyone has joined the Figma team, and gotten to review preliminary design. Received feedback on allowing users to change themes/colors, settings/profile pages, possible features like various data visualizations and moveable UI elements.

#### Next Week's Plans & Goals

* Come up with Logo
* Flesh out other pages
* Design Sub-UI elements (add task popup)

### Tristan Vosburg

#### Goals

* Implement WebSpeechAPI into backend.
* Test voice input and ensure the WebSpeechAPI voice input is working properly.

#### Progress & Issues

* The other person who is working on backend has made a simple test website, so figuring out how the test website works and how to implement it with our main website is important.

#### Next Week's Plans & Goals

* My primary goal is to get the WebSpeechAPI functional in our project.
