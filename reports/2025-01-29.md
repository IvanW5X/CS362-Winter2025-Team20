# Week 4 Project Report

## Team Report

### Progress & Issues

* This week was all about project architecture, communication, and actually starting developement of TalkTask. Deliverables include importing the WebSpeech API to the frontend, connecting the database to the backend, importing the AI model to backend, and lots of directory setup. Team meetings have been hosted over zoom to discuss how the frontend components will be divided and the backend directory has been structured according to popular and modular web backend architecture. Many of the files and folders included have been split up modularly to keep everything scalable and seperate of each other, so when the testing phase comes, it shall be completed more easily. The UI sketches are nearly complete and just need some finishing touches, and client/server communication has been established and ready for logic. The trello board has also been updated to reflect the tasks of each team member, so constant communication on whos doing what can be minimized.

### Next Week's Plans & Goals

* 

## Individual Contributions

### Jordan Cowan

#### Goals

* My primary goal is to have gotten an understanding of how the app should be designed and what I need to have learned to get started on that.
* Next I plan to have started work on the project, primarily with designing the main functionality of the site such as a section for the to-do list, to create tasks, delete tasks, and complete tasks.

#### Next Week's Plans & Goals

*

### Ivan Wong

#### Goals

* Find a suitable backend web server hosting service or tool that is free of charge.
* Coordinate with Bailey (UX/UI Designer) and backend developers to discuss how our project will be implemented, so that I can configure our files according to OO practices.

#### Progress & Issues

* This week I managed to find and test Render, a backend web service hosting platform, to deploy our backend server. I've run it with our frontend client and it works as intended, so I have suspended the service, until we create an MVP. I've also hosted meetings over zoom to discuss our UI design ideas with the team and went over the project directory setup, to explain what changes I've made to the directory. I split the frontend directory to include seperate pages, UI components, and a services folder. I split the backend directory to include a controller, db (database), middleware, routes, services, and an updated index.js file according to standard web development practices, keeping everything modular and ready for development. I also created and added a test file in my own configurations branch to include an AI model from hugging face. I managed to get it working, but I have yet to find a suitable AI model small enough (< 10gb) that works as intended, so more research will be conducted with mini models.

#### Next Week's Plans & Goals

* Find an AI model small enough that is able to generate a relevant, single, suggested task given the context of previous tasks.
* Start researching more backend web developement architecture to create backend files for backend developers to start on.

### Raymond Cen

#### Goals

* Create a list of phrases and words that the correlate with functions created.
* Coordinate with other backend developer on how to divide workload.

#### Progress & Issues

* I came up with a list of potential commands for the website and made a new branch to work on the WebSpeechAPI
* I've implemented an example of an application that uses WebSpeechAPI to get a better understanding of what I need to do. I found out that its more of a frontend thing but it still needs to communicate with the backend to manipulate the tasks. 

#### Next Week's Plans & Goals

* Test voice input and ensure the WebSpeechAPI voice input is working properly.
* Implement WebSpeechAPI with the purpose of also implementing commands into the API.

### Bailey Budlong

#### Goals

* Communicate with front end developers about proposed UI design

#### Next Week's Plans & Goals

### Tristan Vosburg

#### Goals

* Implement WebSpeechAPI into backend.
* Test voice input and ensure the WebSpeechAPI voice input is working properly.

#### Progress & Issues

* The other person who is working on backend has made a simple test website, so figuring out how the test website works and how to implement it with our main website is important.

#### Next Week's Plans & Goals

* My primary goal is to get the WebSpeechAPI functional in our project.
