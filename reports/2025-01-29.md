## Individual Contributions

### Jordan Cowan

#### Goals

* My primary goal is to have gotten an understanding of how the app should be designed and what I need to have learned to get started on that.
* Next I plan to have started work on the project, primarily with designing the main functionality of the site such as a section for the to-do list, to create tasks, delete tasks, and complete tasks.

### Raymond Cen

#### Goals

* Create a list of phrases and words that the correlate with functions created.
* Coordinate with other backend developer on how to divide workload.

#### Progress & Issues

* I came up with a list of potential commands for the website and made a new branch to work on the WebSpeechAPI
* I've implemented an example of an application that uses WebSpeechAPI to get a better understanding of what I need to do. I found out that its more of a frontend thing but it still needs to communicate with the backend to manipulate the tasks. 

#### Next Week's Plans & Goals

* Test voice input and ensure the WebSpeechAPI voice input is working properly.
* Implement WebSpeechAPI with the purpose of also implementing commands into the API.

### Bailey Budlong
