# Week 3 Project Report
## Team Report
### Progress & Issues
* This week was all about documentation. All team members have contributed a lot of content towards the living document file and we've also transfered the living doc from google docs -> .md file, so that we can all get used to markdown files and how they are formatted. We included all requirements for living doc as of 1/22/2025 and other team members have revised other team members work, so that we are all on the page and no one is left confused. Ivan finished his documentation a little early and begun to setup tools in the front and backend directories to allow them to run seperately, but communicate with each other using APIs. Bailey is still working on the UI design using Figma and

### Ivan Wong
#### Goals
* Find all essential technologies that are free and necessary for our project and I will do so by using various resources, such as Google, YouTube, and even open source Git repositories.
* Start formatting our src files and directories, so that it is organized and easily scalable for future features.
#### Progress & Issues
* I managed to format our project files, so that we can include front and backend directories and included a components folder to store our React components in a modularized manner.
* I found all of the essential tools and APIs needed for development, but came across some issues with finding a tool to host our backend web server for free. Many of the free hosting services out there, simply don't give us enough memory to work with for all of our use cases with constant API calls from the database and AI API model. Further research needs to be conducted and coordinated with Kai (database developer) for estimating how many resources a database requires, as well researching how many resources our overall project needs.
#### Next Week's Plans & Goals
* Find a suitable backend web server hosting service or tool that is free of charge.
* Coordinate with Bailey (UX/UI Designer) and backend developers to discuss how our project will be implemented, so that I can configure our files according to OO practices.


### Raymond Cen
#### Goals
* Web Speech API communication method with backend is shared with other backend developer.
#### Progress & Issues
* This week I research on the implementation of WebSpeechAPI. The implementation seems easy as you only need to import it and then set it up in the backend main file.
* An issue I encounter was that some commands/features only works on certain web browsers. Others such as Firefox, the he SpeechGrammar interface will not work for it. I will need to do some research on this.
#### Next Week's Plans & Goals
* Create a list of phrases and words that the correlate with functions created.
* Coordinate with other backend developer on how to divide workload.
