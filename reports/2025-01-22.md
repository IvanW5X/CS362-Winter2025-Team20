# Week 3 Project Report
## Team Report
### Progress & Issues
* This week was all about documentation. All team members have contributed a lot of content towards the living document file and we've also transfered the living doc from google docs -> .md file, so that we can all get used to markdown files and how they are formatted. We included all requirements for living doc as of 1/22/2025 and other team members have revised other team members work, so that we are all on the page and no one is left confused. Ivan finished his documentation a little early and begun to setup tools in the front and backend directories to allow them to run seperately, but communicate with each other using APIs. Bailey is still working on the UI design using Figma and 
### Next Week's Plans & Goals
* With the amount of documentation needed for this course while also developing the project, we plan on appointing a designated leader to schedule and plan out tasks within a timely manner, so that we stick to our timeline and hold each other accountable.
* Finish a rough sketch of the UI, so that frontend developers can start implementing UI features.
* Configure and import essential APIs for backend development, such as the WebSpeech API, AI model API, and client-server side communication APIs.
* Jordan, Nicholas, Bailey - Finish UI sketch and begin UI development.
* Tristan, Ivan, Raymond - Configure and import backend APIs.
* Kai - Design framework for CRUD architecture and scheme of database implementation.
## Individual Contributions

### Jordan Cowan
#### Goals
* I am going to get familiar with React and how to use it so I can start coding. On top of this, I will be helping finish up the slides and working with the group to figure out how we plan on presenting. Lastly, it will be time to start looking at the next assignment in this projects series.
#### Progress & Issues
* So far I have only just scratched the surface of react, I haven't started any implementation just yet but I have started familiarizing myself with its usage.
* The primary issue I've had has only been personal as I haven't had too much time due to work and my other classes. I am, however, making steady progress where I need to.
#### Next Week's Plans & Goals
* My primary goal is to have gotten an understanding of how the app should be designed and what I need to have learned to get started on that.
* Next I plan to have started work on the project, primarily with designing the main functionality of the site such as a section for the to-do list, to create tasks, delete tasks, and complete tasks.

### Ivan Wong
#### Goals
* Find all essential technologies that are free and necessary for our project and I will do so by using various resources, such as Google, YouTube, and even open source Git repositories.
* Start formatting our src files and directories, so that it is organized and easily scalable for future features.
#### Progress & Issues
* I managed to format our project files, so that we can include front and backend directories and included a components folder to store our React components in a modularized manner.
* I found all of the essential tools and APIs needed for development, but came across some issues with finding a tool to host our backend web server for free. Many of the free hosting services out there, simply don't give us enough memory to work with for all of our use cases with constant API calls from the database and AI API model. Further research needs to be conducted and coordinated with Kai (database developer) for estimating how many resources a database requires, as well researching how many resources our overall project needs.
#### Next Week's Plans & Goals
* Find a suitable backend web server hosting service or tool that is free of charge.
* Coordinate with Bailey (UX/UI Designer) and backend developers to discuss how our project will be implemented, so that I can configure our files according to OO practices.

### Raymond Cen
#### Goals
* Web Speech API communication method with backend is shared with other backend developer.
#### Progress & Issues
* This week I research on the implementation of WebSpeechAPI. The implementation seems easy as you only need to import it and then set it up in the backend main file.
* An issue I encounter was that some commands/features only works on certain web browsers. Others such as Firefox, the he SpeechGrammar interface will not work for it. I will need to do some research on this.
#### Next Week's Plans & Goals
* Create a list of phrases and words that the correlate with functions created.
* Coordinate with other backend developer on how to divide workload.

* ### Bailey Budlong
#### Goals
* Brainstorm sketches for overall UI design to share with team
#### Progress & Issues
* I better understand our apps functionality/scope so I can make a suitable UI.
* Started Figma design, but felt quite generic/aimless. Now with a better mental image of the app, and through making some sketches, the design should become more clear and better quality.
#### Next Week's Plans & Goals
* Communicate with front end developers about proposed UI design
* Share sketches with team
