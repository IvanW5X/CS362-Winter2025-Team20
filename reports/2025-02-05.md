# Week 5 Project Report

## Team Report

### Progress & Issues

* This week, we finished our project architecture diagrams and have selected almost all of our APIs needed for out project. The MongoDB database has been fully setup with all the required schemas and CRUD operations, and now just needs to be configured to fit in with the rest of our code. The UI designs from Figma have also been completed for both the landing and user home page. Development of speech recognition functionality, to-do list management, home page, and the AI models have been started and changes relating to them have been placed into their own branches until full functionality is complete.

### Next Week's Plans & Goals

* Next week we are still implementing our application. We've already established roles and a timeline so everyone should know what they are doing.
* By the end of next we should have essentially a rough product with some functionalities implemented and a fleshed out UI with mock tasks.
* Brief goals for each role:
* Jordan, Nicholas, Bailey - Implement UI look without functionalities.
* Tristan, Raymond - Implement add and remove voice commands using WebSpeechAPI.
* Kai - Finish CRUD operations and expand attributes for user.
* Ivan - Ensure APIs, such as ones used for recommending tasks, are working as intended in full program.

## Individual Contributions

### Raymond Cen

#### Goals

* Implement WebSpeechAPI that takes in voice and parses input string for use later. 

#### Progress & Issues

* I've started the implementation last week but I've found out that parsing a string and detecting delimiters was harder than I originally planned. I'm still working on it but I'm just a little bit behind on the Trello board. So I haven't started on implementing the voice commands, just basic string parsing in JavaScript. Currently working on how to store the strings and detect delimiters. But I will have it done before this week's Wednesday so I am on track for next week's goal.

#### Next Week's Plans & Goals

* Implement add and remove functionality using WebSpeechAPI.


### Ivan Wong

#### Goals

* Find an AI model small enough that is able to generate a relevant, single, suggested task given the context of previous tasks.
* Start researching more backend web developement architecture to create backend files for backend developers to start on.

#### Progress & Issues

* I found multiple AI models that are small enough to be used for our website, but now I'm coming across issues with the responses it gives. It produces much more than necessary even when instructed to produce a single task, so I'll have to look into training the AI model and fine-tuning them to produce an accurate response. More research was conducted on the overall project architecture and I'm deciding to implement a variation of the MVC backend architecture using routers, controllers, and services to link requests with their corresponding response. I started creating more files in my configurations branch and will get it pushed once I get it all setup; it shouldn't take me past tommorow.

#### Next Week's Plans & Goals

* Switch to the transformers library, replacing the inference library to fine-tune my choice of AI model for our use case.
* Refactor current backend source files to an even higher level of abstraction using the controllers concept.
* Start researching OAuth and how to itegrate it to our project.

### Bailey Budlong

#### Goals

* Generate unique visual assets, and refine UI design

#### Progress & Issues

* I had a few midterm exams this past week which unfortunately took time away from working on the UI design. So I admittedly didn't make much progress on the overall UI design.
* I did work on designing a logo. I have a preliminary logo created to use for the midpoint presentation. I'm pretty happy with the concept, I'm still unsure about the exact styling. I expect to get feedback from the team, and will look into what revisions I want to make myself.

#### Next Week's Plans & Goals

* Help implement designs with other front end developers
* Creat Figma designs for sub-UI elements (task creation menu, profile, etc)

### Jordan Cowan

#### Goals

* My plans for next week are to get the tasks portion working along with looking like a task as shown in the ui/ux designers draft of our app.
* On top of this I will be adding the "If there are particular assumptions underpinning your chosen architecture, identify and describe them." section of the living doc as to be inline with the project architecture and design assignment.

#### Progress & Issues

* I have got the css almost finished for the tasks and site to look like the figma design but I have yet to properly implement the ability to add, update, and delete tasks.
* I did get the living doc section completed.

#### Next Week's Plans & Goals

* I plan to get the Tasks usability finished by next week.
* I plan to have started on the landing page.

### Tristan Vosburg

#### Goals

* Living Doc: Project Schedule
* Living Doc: Testing Schedule

#### Progress & Issues

* I was exceptionally sick this week and was unable to fully help with coding.  Moving forward I will be fully able to assist.

#### Next Week's Plans & Goals

* Add functionality to tokenize and error handle speech input string
* Simple WebSpeechAPI Implementation: Implement WebSpeechAPI into backend
