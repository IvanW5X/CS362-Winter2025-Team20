### Next Week's Plans & Goals

* Next week we are still implementing our application. We've already established roles and a timeline so everyone should know what they are doing.
* By the end of next we should have essentially a rough product with some functionalities implemented and a fleshed out UI with mock tasks.
* Brief goals for each role:
* Jordan, Nicholas, Bailey - Implement UI look without functionalities.
* Tristan, Raymond - Implement add and remove voice commands using WebSpeechAPI.
* Kai - Finish CRUD operations and expand attributes for user.
* Ivan - Ensure APIs, such as ones used for recommending tasks, are working as intended in full program.

## Individual Contributions

### Raymond Cen

#### Goals

* Implement WebSpeechAPI that takes in voice and parses input string for use later. 

#### Progress & Issues

* I've started the implementation last week but I've found out that parsing a string and detecting delimiters was harder than I originally planned. I'm still working on it but I'm just a little bit behind on the Trello board. So I haven't started on implementing the voice commands, just basic string parsing in JavaScript. Currently working on how to store the strings and detect delimiters. But I will have it done before this week's Wednesday so I am on track for next week's goal.

#### Next Week's Plans & Goals

* Implement add and remove functionality using WebSpeechAPI.
