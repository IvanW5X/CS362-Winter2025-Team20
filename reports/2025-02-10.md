#### Goals

* Implement WebSpeechAPI that takes in voice and parses input string for use later. 

#### Progress & Issues

* I've started the implementation last week but I've found out that parsing a string and detecting delimiters was harder than I originally planned. I'm still working on it but I'm just a little bit behind on the Trello board. So I haven't started on implementing the voice commands, just basic string parsing in JavaScript. Currently working on how to store the strings and detect delimiters. But I will have it done before this week's Wednesday so I am on track for next week's goal.

#### Next Week's Plans & Goals

* Implement add and remove functionality using WebSpeechAPI.
