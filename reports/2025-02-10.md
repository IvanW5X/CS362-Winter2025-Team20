# Week 5 Project Report

## Team Report

### Progress & Issues

* This week, we finished our project architecture diagrams and have selected almost all of our APIs needed for out project. The MongoDB database has been fully setup with all the required schemas and CRUD operations, and now just needs to be configured to fit in with the rest of our code. The UI designs from Figma have also been completed for both the landing and user home page. Development of speech recognition functionality, to-do list management, home page, and the AI models have been started and changes relating to them have been placed into their own branches until full functionality is complete.

### Next Week's Plans & Goals

## Individual Contributions

### Raymond Cen

#### Goals

* Implement WebSpeechAPI that takes in voice and parses input string for use later. 

#### Progress & Issues

* I've started the implementation last week but I've found out that parsing a string and detecting delimiters was harder than I originally planned. I'm still working on it but I'm just a little bit behind on the Trello board. So I haven't started on implementing the voice commands, just basic string parsing in JavaScript. Currently working on how to store the strings and detect delimiters.

#### Next Week's Plans & Goals

* Implement

### Ivan Wong

#### Goals

* Find an AI model small enough that is able to generate a relevant, single, suggested task given the context of previous tasks.
* Start researching more backend web developement architecture to create backend files for backend developers to start on.

#### Progress & Issues

* I found multiple AI models that are small enough to be used for our website, but now I'm coming across issues with the responses it gives. It produces much more than necessary even when instructed to produce a single task, so I'll have to look into training the AI model and fine-tuning them to produce an accurate response. More research was conducted on the overall project architecture and I'm deciding to implement a variation of the MVC backend architecture using routers, controllers, and services to link requests with their corresponding response. I started creating more files in my configurations branch and will get it pushed once I get it all setup; it shouldn't take me past tommorow.

#### Next Week's Plans & Goals

* Switch to the transformers library, replacing the inference library to fine-tune my choice of AI model for our use case.
* Refactor current backend source files to an even higher level of abstraction using the controllers concept.
* Start researching OAuth and how to itegrate it to our project.
