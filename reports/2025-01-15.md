# Week 2 Project Report
<br>

## Team Report

### Progress & Issues
This week we started figuring out our project along with some of the details surrounding that. <br>
We also finished everything except the slideshow for the "Project Idea Presentation and Report" assignment. <br>
Besides this there hasn't been much of anything else just yet, this has been the setup week before we get started on development. <br>

#### Next Week's Plans & Goals
I am going to get familiar with React and how to use it so I can start coding. On top of this, I will be helping finish up the slides and working with the group to figure out how we plan on presenting. Lastly, it will be time to start looking at the next assignment in this projects series.
