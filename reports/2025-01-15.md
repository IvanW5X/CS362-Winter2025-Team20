# Week 2 Project Report

## Team Report
### Progress & Issues
* This week we started figuring out our project idea along with some of the details surrounding that. We've initialized our configuration files for website using Node.js, React, and Vite, as well as begun researching which technologies and libraries are needed for the project. We also finished everything except the slideshow for the "Project Idea Presentation and Report" assignment. Besides this there hasn't been much of anything else just yet, this has been the setup week before we get started on development and creating test cases.
### Next Week's Plans & Goals
* By next week, we will have all the essential external libraries and technologies needed to start developing the project. Our goal development wise is to start the design of the UI using a mockup website or app, and begin implementing basic to-do list managment functionality. We will do so by allowing each member begin their processes of development according to their role and hopefully, we will have more that "Hello TalkTask" for our web application. The following bullet points indicate which team member is responsible for each action.
* Jordan, Nicholas, Bailey - Begin designing the UI for the website
* Tristan, Raymond - Begin designing to-do list managment functionality
* Kai - Begin researching database implementation
* Ivan - Select tools and technologies needed for the project

## Individual Contributions

### Jordan Cowan
#### Goals
* NA
#### Progress & Issues
* Set up the Trello Project Board.
* Created the slide show for our project and designed it.
#### Next Week's Plans & Goals
* I am going to get familiar with React and how to use it so I can start coding. On top of this, I will be helping finish up the slides and working with the group to figure out how we plan on presenting. Lastly, it will be time to start looking at the next assignment in this projects series.

### Ivan Wong
#### Goals
* NA
#### Progress & Issues
* This week (and last week), I initialized the website configuration files for React + Vite and contributed to the living document, as well as created and finished the team resources file. I've also began researching which technologies and APIs will be needed for our project and included the links to the documentation.
* Some issues I've come across when researching the technologies were that some APIs were blocked by a paywall, so further investigating is needed to determine which APIs are free and fit our use cases.
#### Next Week's Plans & Goals
* By next week, I will have found all essential technologies that are free and necessary for our project and I will do so by using various resources, such as Google, YouTube, and even open source Git repositories.
* Another goal I have for next week is to start formatting our src files and directories, so that it is organized and easily scalable for future features.

### Raymond Cen
#### Goals
* NA
#### Progress & Issues
* Last week I contributed to the living document and finished my part. This week I am looking into the Web Speech API and how to use it for our needs. Specifically how to seamlessly incorporate it into the website.
#### Next Week's Plans & Goals
* Next week I plan to look into Web Speech API more as well as get familiar with all of the tools we will be using.
* Another for next week is to get an idea of how the website will be formatted.

### NAME
### Kai Lindskog
#### Goals
* Research MongoDB database in connection to React.
* Be more fluent in communication.
#### Progress & Issues
* Completed 'Why' portion of group presentation, began researching the best database to use for our site, and contributed to the living document. I had some issues setting up mongoDB, as well as learning React. I have had a very tightly packed schedule and have had troubles communicating. This being said, I have very high hopes!
#### Next Week's Plans & Goals
* Create and connect the mongoDB database
* Start planning for data generated user suggestions (with consent)
* Establish requiremnts for the coming aspects in the project.
