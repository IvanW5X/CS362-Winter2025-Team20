# Project: TalkTask  
## Your Personal To-Do List Tracker

### Abstract:
TalkTask is a web application that utilizes speech recognition to streamline to-do list management. Using speech recognition, we are able to allow users to add, remove, prioritize, and even schedule daily tasks with simple voice commands for multiple languages including, but not limited to English, Spanish, French, and more. Designed with accessibility and flexibility in mind, TalkTask provides a hands-free and user-friendly experience across various devices such as desktops and mobile devices. The platform prioritizes ease-of-access for all users and user privacy, ensuring secure handling of voice input. Stretch goals or future iterations aim to implement a database to allow users to save and store their tasks after going offline, and set reminders for upcoming tasks if given a time requirement.

### Overall Goal:
The goal of our application is to improve accessibility to users while allowing users to maintain an optimal lifestyle where they can efficiently plan their day. Our application addresses the issue of accessibility in current to-do list applications. Users today are required to interact with a mouse, keyboard, touchscreen or something similar in order to use such an application. But with our application, by using voice input and voice commands, our application aims to help users perform the essential features of a to-do list application through manual hands-on input and voice input.

### Major Goals:
1. Utilize speech recognition to allow for ease-of-access for to-do list management.
2. Implement a database to store past list items and provide external storage for user tasks.
3. Use an AI model to recommend tasks based on previous tasks.
4. Implement a simple, but clean UI, so users can uitilize the full capabilities of TalkTask easily.

### Stretch Goals:
1. Implement reminders for timely tasks to increase the success rate of tasks being completed.  
2. Extend AI API functionality to process natural language and allow users to communicate naturally to our speech recognition system and convert their commands into a dedicated function for the to-do list management system.
3. Gamify the web application to keep current users engaged and promote continuation of using the app into continuing using our app for productivity. 

### Current Practice:
The current practice of today is that users can add and delete tasks, set start or due dates, provide descriptions for the tasks and mark them as completed or incomplete. Tasks can also be categorized into different groups for it to be more easily visualized. Organization of the tasks can depend on due date, priority or status. While these are useful, there are many limits to this current practice. Most of the modern-day to-do list applications require manual input. Requiring users to interact with a mouse, keyboard, touchscreen or something similar. These types of interactions can be inaccessible to many people, especially to those with physical disability in their hands. For example, typing tasks and marking/clicking tasks. It also requires the user to focus on the screen to see what they are doing. Which can be an inconvenience when a hands-free option may be preferred.  

### Novelty:
The to-do list is a powerful tool that can be used to help organize, categorize, and optimize a given time period. In our current day, there are many different versions of the to-do list on the market today; including some made by major corporations like Microsoft and Apple. Our team is aiming to create a to-do list that can be tailored to a user-specific time period. We aim to create a UI that is accessible to all users, while putting a unique touch. We plan to implement a database that can be utilized in creating user task suggestions, aiding in user productivity and usability. We plan to implement a speech recognition API that allows users to speak their goals into the page, as well as navigate through menus and actions with their voice.

Our to-do list will be different in the way that it will draw from many common day practices of the present to better aid the person in their own daily lives. The to-do list can be utilized beyond a simple stack of deliverables, and we feel that it can be used to help organize much more than oneâ€™s day. Using modern day technology, we are able to create a product that seperates us from other competitors by using speech recognition, AI models, and a database to give users access to a personal to-do list that works on various devices, free of charge.

### Effects: 
As with other to-do list applications, ours will help users plan their time efficiently. However, TalkTask also has greater accessibility for users, due to the speech recognition. People with disabilities will find it easier to use compared to traditional lists, and not all applications have this accessibility option. Non-native speakers will also have their experience improved, as there are multiple language options. Our application focuses on accessibility first, as that is very important for software that a lot of different people might use. Because of this focus on efficiency and accessibility, multitaskers will also enjoy using the software. They can use voice recognition to quickly create and edit lists, compared to the more traditional, slower applications. We want to create an application that is simple to use but that also accompanies different types of users. If successful, our application will be easier to use than previous to-do lists and address previous accessibility concerns.

### Non-functional Requirements:
* When code is deployed for users to access, it should be kept and maintained with security in mind.  Bad-faith actors shouldn't have easy access to any holes.
* 
* 

### External Requirements:
* **How weâ€™ll host the application for users to access:**
* **How weâ€™ll handle errors, invalid user inputs, etc:**  
* **How weâ€™ll allow others to setup their own instance of our application:**

### Technical Approach:
Our web application will be implemented using many frameworks and APIs, such as the React framework for frontend development, the Vite build tool for efficient builds and improved performance, JavaScript for backend/business logic, and (hopefully) Netlify to publish our website onto the internet. The main component of the project will be based on the WebSpeech API, which will be used to get input from the user, so that our program will be able to parse it and handle the commands given. We will split up the user interface into components for a modular design, so that with each sprint, we are able to integrate changes and features seamlessly and effectively. Additionally, we will use tools like MongoDB to implement a database and user accounts to store tasks onto the cloud, so that users will be able to exit and return to the application with their previous session data saved on other devices. Another feature we plan to implement will include the use of an open source AI model to recommend tasks based on user's previous task history, to a provide more personalized product for our users. Collaboration and communication will be done via Git, MS Teams, Zoom, text messages, and in-person meetings to increase productivity and push changes into the codebase. Other tools, such as Figma are will be used for a reference as to how our web UI will be designed, so that thereâ€™s no room for ambiguity for how the UI shall be implemented. Further research will be conducted by our software configuration coordinator (Ivan) to provide tools that will make our lives as developers easier.

### Risk:
There are a few risks facing our group as we attempt to design, create and implement this application. We have worked together as a group before, so we are aware of the fact that we are prone to procrastination and underestimating the work required to complete certain tasks. To avoid this problem, we plan on setting checkpoints for what we expect to have completed each week. Additionally, each checkpoint will have small tasks associated with it. Each group member will be responsible for completing their small tasks. At each stand-up meeting, the status of each small task will be checked in to see if help is needed, changes need to be made, or if our stretch goals can be attempted because we are ahead of schedule. Our second challenge is implementing a user database so that separate users can use the application, along with state being preserved between uses and devices. To minimize the risk of difficulty of this task, we will ensure that team members with skills in database managment or have previously taken a database course at OSU will be responsible for leading the database development side of things. The third risk we will come across is implementing the main features with the WebSpeechAPI and the open source AI model. These will impose risks because our program must be able to handle all to-do list functionality through speech, so being able to parse and process voice commands will be a challenge. Adding AI features will also include another layer of complexity because our program must be able to handle the AI processing data and producing tangible results that we as developers, must be able to verify with unique test cases. Our plan to simplify these last two processes is by utilitizing internet sources, documentation, and implementing these features incrementally, so that we can push a MVP earlier and break down full functionality into smaller, more manageable tasks. We plan on designing our features, so that they will rely on dependencies and by keeping a modular design, we are able to develop features in parallel, increasing productivity and speeding up the SDLC for a MVP and/or a finalized product.
